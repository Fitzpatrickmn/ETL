# Mass Shootings x Gun Control Laws (By State)

ETL (Extract, Transform, & Load) using Python & SQL

2020 is a big election year, and most of the general public can agree that there are a number of hot topics that will be heavily debated. Gun violence and corresponding gun control initiatives have come to the forefront of political chatter. The aim of this ETL project is to shed light on the data behind gun laws, by state, as they correlate to mass shootings over the past 12 months. Logic would suggest that the tighter the gun laws are, by state, the fewer shootings occur, by state. By extracting information from three distinct data sets (2019 mass shootings, gun ownership laws by state, and registered weapons by state) and manipulating the data accordingly, we illustrate the clear and jarring correlation between states with loose gun laws and mass shootings over the last year.
